## What is Pacifist?  

**Pacifist** is a powerful macOS utility that allows users to **open, explore, and extract files from installation packages, disk images, and compressed archives**. Unlike the standard macOS installer, which hides the installation process behind a simple interface, Pacifist gives you **complete visibility and control** over every component inside a package.  

It’s widely used by **IT administrators, advanced macOS users, developers, and digital archivists** who need deeper insight into how software is structured and installed. However, it’s also simple enough for everyday users who just want to extract or restore files without reinstalling an entire app.  

Some of the most common use cases include:  
- **System repair and recovery**: restore a single corrupted file from macOS installer packages instead of reinstalling the full system.  
- **Selective installation**: install only specific files from a `.pkg` or `.dmg`, saving space and avoiding unnecessary components.  
- **Archive exploration**: inspect `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.xar`, and many other archive formats directly.  
- **Developer workflow**: analyze the structure of macOS software distributions for debugging or learning purposes.  
- **Version control**: compare files between different macOS updates or app versions to see what has changed.  
- **File validation**: check file integrity with Pacifist’s ability to verify signatures and confirm version numbers.  

The interface is designed to be both **intuitive and efficient**: you can drag-and-drop any archive or installer onto Pacifist, quickly browse its contents in a Finder-like view, and then decide whether to extract, replace, or install files.  

What makes Pacifist stand out is its combination of **flexibility and precision**. It not only supports modern package and archive types but also retains compatibility with older macOS installation files, making it a versatile tool for both legacy systems and the latest Apple Silicon Macs.  

In essence, Pacifist is more than just a file extractor—it’s a **maintenance and troubleshooting toolkit** for macOS that empowers users with transparency, accuracy, and control over their systems.
